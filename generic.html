									When I was in college, my purpose was to get my accounting degree. I wanted to continue what I started in high school. 
									What I didn't knew and I came to realize that my passion is not this and I decided to change my path. Perhaps I had missed the boat on my destiny 
									somewhere along the way? Perhaps a career in programming was where I could shine? And so I pursued that new dream, studying web development at The 
									Informal School of IT. As a web developer, I’m inspired by a clean code written with some solid thoughts in mind, it feels so good. Kind of feeling 
									that is not similar to anything else. For me, developing the web goes as building own castle. It doesn't matter whether it's a project for a client, 
									friend or just a personal practice. Until I'm done it's my castle, and it's sure thing inspiring to know you've built something strong and versatile. 
									Basically, being sure everything is done by the best way possible and that it will function even when I'm done coding.
									After I graduated The Informal School of IT, I began improving my skills, learning more about developing, searching more information. Writing code 
									became my priority, even today. I started working on a few personal projects. So, now and further future, this passion remains with me. 
									There’s certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve and yet more to build.
								</p>
								<p>
									Skills/Interests: PHP, Laravel, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Git, Github, SQL, Ubuntu.
								</p>

									If you’re interested in grabbing coffee and talking about coding, please send an email.
